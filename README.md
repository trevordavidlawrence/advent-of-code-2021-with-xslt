# 2021 Advent of Code

My XSLT solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021 challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

## Setting up

Download [Saxon-HE `10xx`](http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/Saxon-HE/10/Java) and place the JAR in the root directory.

## Running

Run the puzzle solving code this way (update JAR name as appropriate):

```bash
java -jar saxon-he-10.6.jar -xsl:<path_to_xsl> -it
```
